Formerly known as the "Sylvan Scene" the project's final name is "Earth 3058: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Homogeneous Coordinates." There's a great story behind it, which you can find [here](http://167finalproject.blogspot.com/), along with a demo video.

Written largely in C/C++ and GLSL we implemented the following features:
- Procedurally generated terrain
- Procedurally generated plants, using L-systems
- Particle effects
- Piecewise Bezier curves (splines)
- Camera overlay (it kinda looks like an instagram filter, so we kept it)
